# GomokuGame
For evaluation purposes only.
This exercise is based on an strategy board game “Gomoku”, also called five in a row or connect 5 (Gomoku - Wikipedia). It’s a two player game and can be played using a 15 × 15 board. Player alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Once the stone is placed, it cannot be moved or removed from the board. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# The Task
The task is to implement a state tracking API that must support following logic:
- Create a board
- Place a stone and report back whether the placement resulted in a win
No graphical interface is required.
